# Zurkas Disc

A simple LAN-based group chat that runs from a single HTML file.  
No backend, no setup — open it in a browser and everyone on the local network can chat together.

This project was made for school to let friends communicate safely over a LAN.  
It is open-source. I don’t own the rights to any names or ideas referenced here.  
Use, modify, and experiment however you want — just don’t sell it.  
If you build on it, please leave some form of credit.

The app may be updated in the future with improvements or new features.

## Getting Started
Download the latest HTML file and run it in your browser.
